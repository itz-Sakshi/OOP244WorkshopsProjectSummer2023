In this workshop, I learned about function templates in C++, which enable us to create generic functions that work with different data types. I implemented two templates: "search" and "listArrayElements." The "search" template finds matches in an array and stores them in a Collection, while the "listArrayElements" template lists array elements with a title. The workshop also covered dynamic arrays, classes, and operator overloading, providing a good example of using dynamic arrays for a resizable collection. 

In the project milestones, I designed classes for a car rental system, implementing member functions, constructors, and overloaded operators. This project allowed me to improve my understanding of templates and object-oriented programming while applying them to real-world scenarios. I encountered some challenges with template requirements, but reviewing course notes and examples helped overcome them. Overall, the workshop and project milestones were valuable learning experiences that enhanced my programming skills.
