Authenticity Declaration :
I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
***********************************************************************/

In this workshop, I learnt many new concepts such as Constructors, destructors and the current object in C++ programming language.
I learnt how we can declare and define an instance of a class by using different overloaded constructor functions each having its own validation and implementation. This concept helped me to understand the overloading of functions topic even more clearly.
While, destructors helped me to understand the importance of freeing up dynamically allocated memory to a class when the object goes out of scope.
Whereas, I even understood how to use the current object to manipulate and modify an object of a class.
