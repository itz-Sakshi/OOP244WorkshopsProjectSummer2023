In completing this workshop, I learned how to define class types. It was quite like defining structures but with a twist of classes having their own member functions. Furthermore, I learned how to privatize data within the class type. While doing the DIY part of this workshop, I understood how to decide which attributes and methods should be made private and which should be made public. Further, I learned how the client code works with the private data within an object by using its public member functions. 

Another interesting concept I learned was using methods of the ‘cout’ object i.e., the standard output device in C++, to format data inserted into the output stream. Honestly, I faced many issues with the display functions because of this newly introduced concept. Actually, I feel it was easy to format data output with the ‘printf’ function in C language than using the cout member functions as the latter requires more typing and involves many control flags.
