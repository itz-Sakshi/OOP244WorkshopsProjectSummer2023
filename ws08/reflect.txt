In this workshop, I learned about two important concepts in C++ programming: virtual functions and abstract base classes. Virtual functions allow classes to change how they behave when inherited by other classes. It's like giving each class a special set of rules that can be adjusted by its child classes.

Abstract base classes, on the other hand, act as templates for other classes to follow. They have some rules that must be implemented by their child classes, but they themselves cannot be used to create objects.

I also learned about inheritance, which is like a way for classes to share their behaviors with other classes. It's like passing down skills and abilities from parents to their children.

Another important thing I learned was how to manage memory dynamically. It's like being careful when using space in the computer's memory so that we don't waste or lose any.

Lastly, I learned about operator overloading, which is like giving special powers to certain symbols in C++. It allows us to use these symbols with our classes in a customized way.

Overall, this workshop taught me some cool ways to design flexible and powerful C++ programs. It was a bit challenging at times, but I feel more confident now and excited to use these new skills in my future projects.
