In this workshop, I learned many new concepts as it was a transition from using C language to using C++ language to write code. But, since C++ is almost a superset of C language, therefore, most of the coding syntax remained the same such as writing constructs, condition statements, defining functions, etc.
However, this workshop also included some new changes such as new header files, and new standard input and output devices such as 'cout' and 'cin'. Moreover, I was introduced to a completely new and interesting topic called namespaces. Furthermore, while doing part 2 of this workshop, I learned a new way to work with pointers which was arithmetic operations on pointers which was quite fascinating as well.
Well, honestly, I didn't face much difficulty in doing this first workshop for OOP, as most of the new topics involved in it, were already properly explained in the class lecture and further detailed explanation about these topics was also available in class notes. However, I struggled slightly a little bit with the 'namespace' concept in part 1, however, after reviewing the class notes, I was able to get rid of the errors.
